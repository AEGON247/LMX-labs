## 🎨 Design Philosophy

> *"Fresh code, spicy designs, and zero bloat."*

Our design system relies on a curated palette of **Eggplant**, **Mango**, **Cream**, and **Pink** to create a visual identity that stimulates the appetite. We prioritize:
1.  **Mobile-First**: Because 90% of food orders happen on a phone.
2.  **Micro-Interactions**: Every click and scroll should feel rewarding.
3.  **Performance**: We don't serve cold soup; our pages load hot and fast.
